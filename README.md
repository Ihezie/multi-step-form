## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation library
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - JS library

### What I learned
During this project, I learned how to use the react-hook-form library to easily create and validate the user-info form in step-one. Also, I learned restraint when it comes to adding animations to applications. I few of the animations I added initially began to interfere with the design and user experience of the app, so I had to coerce myself to prioritize function over fancy aesthetics.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to learn how to leverage AI tools to complete boring boilerplate tasks, so that I can focus on more important aspects of my projects.
